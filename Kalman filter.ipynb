    "## Kalman filters\n",
    "Kalman filters are a way of quantifying uncertainty surrounding the internal state of a dynamical system from a noisey signal. Algorithm works in two phases:\n",
    "1. *Prediction phase*: estimate the current state variables and related uncertainties. \n",
    "2. *Update estimate*: take weighted average of state observation and estimate. Larger weight is given to estimates with greater certainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **state extrapolation** function is produced which is of the form of classic control:\n",
    "$$ \\hat{x}_{n+1,n} = F\\hat{x}_{n,n}  + G u_{n} + w_{n} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, matrices F and G are to be estimated from the **state space**, differential equations. \n",
    "$$ \\dot{x(t)} = Ax(t) + Bu(t) $$\n",
    "$$ \\dot{y(t)} = Cx(t) + Du(t) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing the differerence between **state extrapolation** and **state space**, the former has output of the same units whereas **state space** are differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps involved in derving the *state dynamics matrix*:\n",
    "1. Set up *governing equation*, u which is the sum of derivate\n",
    "2. Isolate the highest order derivative, $\\frac{d^{n}x}{dt^n} = \\frac{d^{n-1}x}{dt^n-1} + \\frac{dx}{dt} + u$\n",
    "3. Set system of equations where $x_{x+1} = \\frac{d^n}{dt^{n}}$\n",
    "4. Set highest $x_{n+1}$ term to $\\frac{d^{n-1}x}{dt^n-1} + \\frac{dx}{dt} + u$\n",
    "5. Express this in matrix form $ \\dot{x(t)} = Ax(t) + Bu(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: to form the weighted sum in uncertainty, the Kalman filter assumes noise to be present in both the *prediction* and *measurement*. The Kalman filter propagates uncertainty recursively and has significant parallels to Bayesian updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher order dynamical systems can be restructured into 'first order differential equations' by defining new variables and substituting higher order terms. \n",

In essence the Kalman gain is an proportion of error in the estimate compared to measurement. The Kalman Gain is then used to calculate the new estimate which is given by\n",
