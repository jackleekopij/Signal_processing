## Uncertainty quantification
Forms of uncertainty:

Epistemic uncertainty - translates to 'knowledge' in Greek, is the uncertainty derived from lack of knowledge of information which can be reduced with further data.
Aleatoric uncertainty - comes from the word "alea" which means "the roll of the dice" and is defined as internal, unexplainable randomness

## Bayesian optimisation:
Bayesian optimisation was pivotal in the implementation of AlphaGo achieving its success ([paper on Bayesian optimisation in AlphaGo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06855.pdf)).

### ML and Physical World - Neil Lawrence
1.	Laplace's demon, full determinism in physical world is not possible.
2.	Machine learning, data + model = prediction. Too much of ML has had pure focus on prediction more work needs to be causal ML to endeavour to understand system = more transferability.
3.	Analogy  of Stochastic Vs Determinism, likened to hurricane Vs Navier-Stokes equation. Be mindful of your model’s granularity.
4.	Physical Vs Simulation Vs emulations. UK's BOM uses too much low level physics, not enough high level emulations /ML.
5.	OR and Machine Learning hasn't come together as of yet. There’s a lot of low hanging fruit to be had at the intersection of these fields.
6.	Separation of concern architecture – again has focused on prediction at the cost of explanability, needs to incorporate causal lens.
