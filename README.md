### ML and Physical World - Neil Lawrence
1. Laplace's demon, full determinism in physical world is not possible.
2. Machine learning, data + model = prediction. Too much of ML has had pure focus on prediction.
3. Stochastic Vs Determinism, likened to hurricane Vs Navier-Stokes equation.
4. Physical Vs Simulation Vs emulations. UK's BOM uses too much low level physics, not enough high level emulations /ML.
5. OR and Machine Learning hasn't come together as of
6. Separation of concern architecture - has focused on prediction at the cost of explanability.
