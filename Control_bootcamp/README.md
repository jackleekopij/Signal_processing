# Kalman filters
Kalman filters are an example of feedback control, where the K feedback value for the feedback system (A-Bk)X is the Kalman gain value.

# Difference equations
Difference equations = discrete
Differential equations = equations

## Time-invariant system
A time-invariant system is a system where output y(t) does only implicitly depends on time through X(t).
A time-invariant system
y(t) = X(t)
Non-time-invariant
y(t) = tx(t)
