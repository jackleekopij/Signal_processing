In following lectures examples are given to show that a LQG regulator may be performant but not robust to uncertainty.

Previously, focus had been placed on *proportional* control i.e. the error betweent desired output, y, and input signal, r, multiplied by the term which was demonstrate in video 28 on cruise control as input $u_{CL} = K \\epsilon = K(r-y)$. However, as shown in the closed example, the control $u_{cl} never converged to the reference speed r, the result output $y_{cl}$ was always slightly lower than reference/biased down. Inclusion of the integral term reduces steady state error to zero.\n",

    "Simplist approach, requires entire episode to be run before a reward can be used. Monte Carlo methods assume that all actions are equal in contribution to the reward of an episode such that the following quality function is produced: \n",
    "$$ Q^{new}(s_k, a_k) = Q^{old} (s_k, a_k) + \\frac{1}{n} (R_\\sigma - Q^{old}(s_k, a_k) ) \\quad  \\forall k \\in [1, \\dots, n]$$\n",

    "Summing up, both Q-learning and SARSA can be thought of as data driven approaches to the dynamic programming approach when a model of environment isn't available. The subtle difference between the two is in *k+1* update step; whereas SARSA updates the Q function following the same policy at $k$ (giving an on policy update) Q Learning takes *greedy* action in the *k+1* step hence said to be off policy. \n",
