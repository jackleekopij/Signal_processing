    "Key takeways of control applications to COVID-19. \n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "- Uncertainty in models\n",
    "- Noise measurments\n",
    "- No defined ways to measure effect of controller\n",
    "- Time varying parameters\n",
    "- Limits on controllabilty - can't shut down essential services\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective feedback control requires sensors AND TIME DELAYS must be overcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control theory is a way to balance imperfect measurements and imperfect models to still make quality control decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control theory and COVID-19: Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus speciifically on disease system and how we can use this system to make decisions. All the models (of infection propagation) are wrong but they are can be leveraged within a control framework to make drive robust outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainties the COVID-19 control system is carrying; \n",
    "- disease system - number of beds available, number of healthcare staff, how people interact\n",
    "- uncertainty of controller - how decisions effect diseases\n",
    "- uncerainty of measurements - how to gain accurate sensors of system\n",
    "- time varying parameters - people get fatigued by too much quarrantine\n",
    "- time-delay\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MOdel predictive control** is only way to deal with ALL these uncertainties at once; \n",
    "Will cover following models: \n",
    "1. Agent based \n",
    "2. Compartmental (differential equations)\n",
    "3. Parameter fit (statistical)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compartmental (differential) \n",
    "SIR model; susceptatble, infected, and recovered defined by differential equations: \n",
    "$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\frac{\\beta}{N}SI$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta}{N}SI - \\gamma I$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gammaI$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters will differe for different groups (by population, age, gender, etc). However, important to be able to disentangle different groups from entire population. \n",
    "\n",
    "We really care about changing the rate of change of infected $\\frac{dI}{dt} $ which is driven by $R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{N}$ where $\\beta$ is parameter we can control by inteventions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agent based models\n",
    "Simulate different types of agents i.e. eseential worker agent vs non-essential worker agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statistical projections \n",
    "Get forecasts for projections of future infections, I using statistical models and then estimate the parameters of the distributions. \n",

    "Understanding COVID-19 from a control perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Control design is an applied optimisation; however, defining cost function for COVID-19 is a difficult problem, can't just optimise for deaths, still need to operate supply chains. \n",
    "Control is extremely important to understand how the system (number of infections) will respond to different actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model predictive control (MPC) extremely valuable from a causal understanding perspective especially when your models are extremely uncertain. One of the most used control strategies in industry. MPC is an extremely important tool in balancing imperfect measurements, system models and controllers to make agile, robust and high performance decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness** - we don't just want to optimise but also have a robust system. If you're system is not robust the system will face instability. \n",
