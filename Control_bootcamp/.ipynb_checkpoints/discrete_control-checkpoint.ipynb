    "We have a continuous plant which we wish to design a controller for; however, controller must be discreteized. This is the focus the lecture, going from continuous to discrete system. There's two options given a coninuous plant: \n",
    "1. Design a continuous controller then discretise the controller.\n",
    "2. Discretize the plant, then design a controller (which is then inherently discrete). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of conversion of continuous to discrete controller. Start with a continuous controller $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$ in the *s-domain*. Conversion to the time domain yields $L^{-1}(G(s)) = g(t) = e^{-t}$, an *exponentially decaying* impulse response in the time domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to discretize the above is to sample the response every T seconds $g[k] = e^{-kt}$ then take the *z-transform* $Zg([k]) = G(z) = \\frac{z}{z-e^T}$\n",

    "When controlling a motor, a controller doesn't send a pulse to the motor and then drop the input to zero in the next time step allowing motor to decrease in speed. Instead a constant input is provided to the motor; this is simply a step function input."
