    "## Three views of a system\n",
    "\n",
    "Any linear time invariant system can represented in three different forms:\n",
    "1. State space representation\n",
    "2. Differential equation (ODE)\n",
    "3. Transfer function (s-domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: any LTI system can be described as a result of its inpulse response, the Dirac delta function at time = 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "A [fantastic resource](https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ModelSimulation) for illustrating these three representations. Example, given *ordinary differntial equation* representation of system, $\\tau_p \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = k_pu$ find the *state space* and the *transfer function* representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. State space representation \n",
    "A state space representation of a dynamical system can be constructed by converting a set of differential equations (generally of order 2 or more) into a system of first order differential equations. Conversion is done by a coordinate transform of the system. The *state space representation* will take the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\\n",
    "Y = Cx + Du\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting to the *state space representation* analysis of stability of a system becomes trivial through analysis of the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Differential equation\n",
    "The differential equation representation of a linear time invariant system is traditional form where rates of change of the state of system/system output are equal to a function of the system's state,, y, plus an input component, u. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Transfer function\n",
    "Transfer function - *the Laplace transform of the impulse response of an LTI system* and provide a methodology to analyse a system in its constituent components. The transfer function representation sets the system as in the frequency (s-)domain. Mapping into the s-domain is through application Laplace transforms. One advantages of the transfer function representation (a by-product of the Laplace transform) is operations on ordinary differential equations become algebraic operations in the s-domain menaing system components can simply be multiplied together avoiding need for complex convolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding convolutions is done by starting with the inpulse response of LTI system, the Dirac delta which is just an input at time = 0. This is then generalised to an artibitrary input which can be thought of as an infinite number of inpulses; thus the arbitrary input = sum(all inpulse response curves); this sum is also called the convolution integral. Given input u(t) and system (inpulse response) g(t) then output $y(t) = \\int^\\infty_0u(\\tau)g(t-\\tau)d\\tau$. However, taking the Laplace transform of U(t), G(t) and Y(t) turns the integral $Y(s) = U(s)G(s)$ where $G(s)$ is the transfer function and reduces the convolution into a simple multiplication."
