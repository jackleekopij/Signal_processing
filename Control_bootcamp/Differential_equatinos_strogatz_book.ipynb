    "*Differential equations* vs *iterated maps*\n",
    "Two types of dynamical systems; *differential equations* and *iterated maps*; continuous and discrete time systems, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Ordinary* vs *partial* differential equations. \n",
    "*Ordinary* have differential equations which are functions of *only one single independent variables* whereas *partial* differential equations have contain differential equations with *two or more independent variables*. **This book only focuses on time varying systems so will focus only on** *ordinary differential equations*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to a differential equation will be a (or set of) function(s) of time. The way a system evolves through time is called the phase space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autonomous vs nonautonomous differential equations\n",
    "Autonomous differential equations are equations which do not have time as an indepdent variable whereas nonautonomous equations explicitly have time as a depedent value."
