    "Any linear time invariant system can represented in three different forms:\n",
    "1. State space representation\n",
    "2. Differential equation (ODE)\n",
    "3. Transfer function (s-domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "A [fantastic resource](https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ModelSimulation) for illustrating these three representations. Example, given *ordinary differntial equation* representation of system, $\\tau_p \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = k_pu$ find the *state space* and the *transfer function* representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. State space representation \n",
    "A state space representation of a dynamical system can be constructed by converting a set of differential equations (generally of order 2 or more) into a system of first order differential equations. Conversion is done by a coordinate transform of the system. The *state space representation* will take the form: \n",

    "$$ \n",
    "\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\\n",
    "Y = Cx + Du\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting to the *state space representation* analysis of stability of a system becomes trivial through analysis of the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Differential equation\n",
    "The differential equation representation of a linear time invariant system is traditional form where rates of change of the state of system/system output are equal to a function of the system's state,, y, plus an input component, u. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Transfer function\n",
    "The transfer function representation sets the system as in the frequency (s-)domain. Mapping into the s-domain is through application Laplace transforms. One advantages of the transfer function representation (a by-product of the Laplace transform) is operations on ordinary differential equations become algebraic operations in the s-domain menaing system components can simply be multiplied together avoiding need for complex convolutions. \n",
